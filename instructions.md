## Welcome!

In this repo you can find two files with the original data. It's a log of financial transactions and reference file for currency conversion.
We'd like to have a basic tool to see the dynamics of the money flow over time.

The point of this asignment is primarily to see your coding practices and approaches to problems. We'd like to see our tool working, but don't worry too much if the calculations are off.
* Please focus on making smaller commits to allow us to understand your reasoning process.


## Requirements

- We should be able to calculate and display the summed up amounts of transactions: 
* Grouped by time frame (Daily, Monthly, Yearly)
* Converted into currency of choice (every currency present in the dataset. We imagine that the currency rates are not changing over time)
* For a certain number of time frames from now
Essetially, we should be able to see the response to a request: "Give me the amounts of monthly transactions convered into Euro for the past 5 months starting from now"

## Backend assignment

Write an application in any Python framework (Python3).
* The API must be a REST, no GQL.
It would be enough if we can do requests and get the results in some API UI (e.g. Swagger).
Add necessary tests.
Real database connection is not required, just use the json files.

## Frontend assignment

Write an application in React with Typescript. You can do all logic on the frontend, without backend at all.
Display the data with a graph of any kind, add interface elements to input the parameters and run the calculations.
You can use any library of your choice.
